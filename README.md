# GitHelper

Create the **.gitconfig** file at:

```
C:\Users\YourUsername\.gitconfig
```

Then add the following content:

```ini
[safe]
    directory = *
```

> ⚠️ This setting allows Git to treat all directories as safe, which suppresses ownership warnings.  
> Use only on your personal machine and **not** in shared or production environments.
